                    <h2>MBBS IN china</h2>
                    <p>
                      China, being the second-largest economy in the world, has
                      some of the world’s finest medical universities. The
                      reason being these Universities can afford to admit
                      international students at such low fees because the
                      country has a very high education budget for the research
                      and development in its medical science field.
                      <br />
                      One of the closest neighbors of India for so many years,
                      China obviously has a long and vast standing history.
                      However because of some disputes with China, many people
                      would think that it would be difficult living in China,
                      but the reality is completely different. Chinese people
                      like Indian culture and are always friendly in their
                      approach towards Indians. They have a welcoming and warm
                      nature. When you visit China, then you will realize that
                      whatever you have been reading or listening about China
                      was totally different from reality.
                      <br />
                      China is investing more and more in education every year.
                      They facilitate the research and scholarships budget of
                      MBBS in China for international students. Since all the
                      Universities in China are Government-owned, the
                      infrastructure developed and the facilities provided in
                      the universities are always maintained at a higher level.
                      Studying medicine in China is well recognized around the
                      world and China has more than 50 universities in the top
                      500 medical universities in the world.
